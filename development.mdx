## About Veritus.ai

### What is Veritus.ai?

Veritus.ai is an AI research platform that helps professors, postdocs, and students save time. It brings paper search, paper insights, and manuscript review into one place. Researchers at Kyoto University, MIT, and IIT Roorkee already use it to finish tasks five times faster.

### How does Veritus.ai differ from other AI research tools?

Most tools only summarize or give short answers. Veritus.ai is different because every answer links back to the original paper, so you can check the source. It also combines multiple workflows—search, analysis, and writing—so you don’t need five separate tools.

### Who should use Veritus.ai?

It’s designed for professors, postdocs, PhD students, and lab leaders. But it also works well for students writing theses or R&D professionals who need fast access to reliable papers.

### Is Veritus.ai free to use?

Yes. You can try a free account with limited searches and analysis. For regular use, there are paid plans for students, researchers, and professors with larger quotas.

## Research-Focused Questions

### How can AI help with systematic literature reviews?

AI can scan thousands of papers quickly and suggest the most relevant ones. Veritus.ai finds the top 100 papers in minutes and organizes them for review, saving researchers weeks of manual work.

### What’s the difference between AI research tools and traditional methods?

Traditional reviews mean reading and sorting papers by hand. AI tools like Veritus.ai speed this up by ranking papers with relevance scores and showing topic trends. You still stay in control of what to include.

### Can AI tools help with research bias detection?

Yes, AI can highlight gaps and imbalances in cited literature. Veritus.ai points out missing areas in your draft and suggests diverse studies, helping reduce citation bias.

### How do I ensure research quality when using AI tools?

Always check that answers link back to the source. Veritus.ai ensures every summary and insight is traceable to the original paper, so you can verify accuracy before citing.

### What are the limitations of AI in academic research?

AI speeds up search and review but does not replace human judgment. It can miss nuance in theory or context. Veritus.ai helps reduce errors, but final decisions always rest with the researcher.

## Advanced Features

### How does the AI research assistant work?

The assistant lets you ask natural questions about a paper. Veritus.ai answers directly and shows the sentence from the PDF it came from.

### Can I customize research parameters?

Yes. You can set keywords, choose focus areas, or highlight papers that match your intent. This guides the AI to refine results.

### What databases does Veritus.ai access?

It draws from over 200 million research papers across open databases and trusted sources. Uploaded PDFs are also analyzed directly.

### How do I set up automated research alerts?

Alerts are part of the upcoming workflow tools. You’ll be able to set keywords and receive updates when new papers match your topic.

### Can I integrate Veritus.ai with other research tools?

Integration options are expanding. For now, you can export citations to reference managers and share reports with collaborators.

## Technical & Troubleshooting

### Why is my research query not returning results?

Check your keywords or try uploading a sample paper. Narrow queries work better than very broad ones.

### How do I resolve authentication issues?

Make sure you’re signing in with the same email you used to register. If problems persist, reset your password or contact support.

### What should I do if the AI analysis seems incorrect?

Review the highlighted source in the PDF. If the issue continues, re-upload the paper or send feedback through the support form.

### How do I report bugs or technical issues?

Use the in-app **Help** button or email [support@veritus.ai](mailto:support@veritus.ai). Include screenshots and steps to help the team reproduce the problem.

### Are there API limits or usage restrictions?

Yes. Free and paid plans have quotas on searches and manuscript reviews. Details are listed on the [pricing page](/docs/pricing).
